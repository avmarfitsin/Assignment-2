Within the repository Assignment 2 are packages for each of the individual problems, named prob(x).java. Accompanying these where necessary are the PDFs, named similarly prob(x).pdf.
Problem 1: A sample usage is available in the main method. The user instantiates an int[] array and calls Problem1Sort(arr, arr.length) on this array.
Problem 2: Similarly to problem 1, an array is instantiated and mergeSort(arr,arr.length) is called to use. A print function is available.
Problem 3: Linked list is initialized with constructor LinkedList(). Items are added with add(int i), and printList() displays the contents of the current linked list.
